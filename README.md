<h1>Q&A App</h1>
<h4>Needed: GO, MySQL, Node.js</h4>
To get started, create a database connection with the <b>username:</b> <i>root</i>, and <b>password:</b> <i>rootroot</i>. I used MySQL Workbench. <br>
After that you can run the <b>startclient</b> and <b>startserver</b> PowerShell files in <i>ask-app-static</i> to start the app.<br><br>
The source code is available in <i>ask-app-source</i>, where you can also run the PowerShell files to start the development server, after installing all necessary dependencies.
<br>
<h3>After you get started, you can use the app to register as a user, log in, ask and answer questions.</h3>
